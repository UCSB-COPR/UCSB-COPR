# UCSB-COPR About the COPR-UCSB GitHub Organization
*Note: This organization is currently under development as we continue to build out repositories and data connections (as of October 2025).*

The **Coal Oil Point Reserve (COPR)** GitHub Organization serves as a centralized space for managing, hosting, and sharing research, data, and outreach projects connected to UCSB‚Äôs Coal Oil Point Reserve. This includes long-term ecological datasets, water quality monitoring, Shiny dashboards, outreach materials, and collaborative tools used by staff, interns, and researchers.

## üîó Repositories and Projects
Click [HERE](https://github.com/COPR-UCSB) to view current repositories hosted by the Reserve.

Each repository supports a specific program area at COPR:
- **copr-water-quality:** Data collection, QA/QC workflows, and analysis for Devereux Slough water sampling.
- **copr-people-counter:** Scripts for analyzing visitor data from the Optiview camera system.

## üéØ Purpose / Motivation
At Coal Oil Point Reserve, dozens of research, monitoring, and outreach projects operate simultaneously. The goal of this GitHub organization is to:
- Preserve and share datasets collected at the Reserve.
- Provide clear documentation and reproducible workflows for staff, interns, and collaborators.
- Increase visibility of research and data-driven projects.
- Strengthen collaboration with UCSB‚Äôs Natural Reserve System and other partner organizations.

This organization complements the broader [UCSB NRS GitHub](https://github.com/UCSB-NRS) effort by focusing specifically on the Coal Oil Point Reserve site.

## üë• Who This Is For
This organization supports:
- COPR staff, interns, and volunteers  
- UCSB students and faculty conducting research at the Reserve  
- Partner organizations and collaborators working on conservation, outreach, and compliance projects  

Whether you‚Äôre managing water quality data, developing apps, or creating educational materials, this space is designed to make collaboration easier and knowledge more accessible.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
Each repository is managed by project leads and connected contributors. The organization‚Äôs structure allows:
- Controlled access for different project teams.
- Shared data pipelines between R, Shiny, and monitoring systems.
- Centralized version control and documentation.

Repositories can be **forked**, **linked**, or **mirrored** with UCSB NRS or other partner organizations upon request.
